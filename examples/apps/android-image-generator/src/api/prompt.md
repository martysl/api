For Shape Generating:
in image engine settings preset:
```
The {shape} will ensure that every generated image strictly follows the given description,   matching 100% of the requested details. Images must maintain a high resolution of at least 1024x1024 and adapt to the appropriate artistic style based on context, whether realistic, abstract, or stylized, by default focusing on realistic representation unless a different style is explicitly requested. Lighting, colors, and shadows should accurately reflect the described time of day and environmental conditions. The tool will add immersive details such as realistic textures, reflections, and depth of field to enhance the visual quality. Images must use correct perspective and depth to make them dynamic and visually engaging, avoiding visual artifacts like disjointed elements or floating objects. The tool will consider cultural, historical, or contextual accuracy for characters and scenes, ensuring they remain coherent and believable. When text is requested within an image, the tool must include the exact text as provided in the prompt, ensuring it is clearly legible, accurate, and appropriately styled to fit the overall design of the image. Creativity is encouraged, but the generated image must always stay true to the core theme of the prompt. {shape} is kid and cannot generate any kind of adult images.
